/*=================  Quiz05: React functional and class components methode =================== */

/* 1- create a react class component and do the following:
   a- create a state called message and initialize it as an empty string, then insert it inside the the returned component.
   b- when the component mounts, change the value of the message state the value to the string "welcome to the jungle"
   c- create a state called message2 and do the same steps as in a and b but change the message2 to "quiz are awesome :)" state when the component updates.
   d- notice what happens in when you run the component and explain it
   e- write a code to prevent this behavior, and explain it
*/
/*       write your code her      */

// The Problem is the components will update and not stop for that the componentDidUpdate will execute and not stop
/* The code to prevent this is compare between pervState and current state if is not equall stop infinit loop */

/* 2- create a functional react component that has a state "insideInput", a state "changeCounter", and a state "number". then add/do the following:
    a- add an input and make it change the "insideInput" state only when you press enter.
    b- add a button that (when clicked) will add 1 to changeCounter and have it rendered above the button
    c- generate a random number to be put inside the number and render it whenever changeCounter is changed
  */

/*       write your code her      */

/* 3- connect the previous two components inside a react app, and add the following:
   a- create a state "crossingState" inside app.js.
   b- render the state inside the class component that you made
   c- have the state setter inside the functional component and make the change method using a dropdown list
   d- the dropdown list will have 5 choices, each choice will be a day of the week, and the state will change based on the day chosen
